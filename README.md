# WorkDay-Scheduler
## A daily planner to create a schedule.
### This is a simple 9 hour day calendar scheduler to save your events as you plan accordingly. The browser takes the inputs from the user and saves it to the local storage.
### The input values from the user will remain untill the user clears/delete the local storage.
### We are also auditing the time and doing color coding for each hour to display the colors accordingly.
### This App is build with HTML, CSS, Java Script, jquery, Moment.js, Bootstrap classes, google fonts, open iconic for icons, popper.js, Web API - DOM Element Properties and local storage for storing the user input values.
#### For fun, I have this little effect on the little document icon while you save it.
